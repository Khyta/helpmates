# About

This is an app for mods to manage promoting and demoting users using specific
user flairs in their subreddits. The buttons to demote and promote users are for
comments only.

# Configuration

Please input the subreddit name where the app is installed on. It's needed for
the flair setting.

The flair ID's need to be taken from the mod tools here: https://www.reddit.com/mod/SUBREDDITNAMEHERE/userflair.

The flairs need to be each on their separate new line. The ordering of the
flairs is important as this will determine the progression of demoting/promoting
the users. The highest and lowest tiers are indicated in the image.
